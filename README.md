# Crack-detection-using-Convolution-Neural-Network
Here we have developed a model which classifies images if there is surface crack or not in the image. If there is crack in the image then we used Image Thresholding to find the area of the crack in the image. We have used elemental image segmentation to find the length of the crack and average width of the crack.
